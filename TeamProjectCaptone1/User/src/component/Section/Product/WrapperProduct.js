          When design meets efficiency and sportiness meets style. When
          innovation and precision go hand-in-hand and progressive elegance
          becomes palpable in every line. When form and function become a
          statement and progress stands above all else. That's when executive
          class has a new pace setter: the Audi A6 Sedan. More athletic than
          ever. As supreme as always. This is your time.
